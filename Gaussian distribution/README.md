## Multi-variate Gaussian distribution
Here we generate random samples from the standard multi-variate(d-demensional) Gaussian distribution, plot the histogram of Euclidean norms of the samples. Then, we calculate and plot the changes on the average and standard deviation of the norms as d incease.
