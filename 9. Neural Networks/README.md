* In demo1, we will fine-tune a pre-trained deep network (ResNet34) for a particular two-class dataset which can be downloaded from the data file.
* In demo2, We will define a multi-layer deep network and use the FashionMNIST dataset to train it.
* In boston_nn, we use boston housing dataset to train a multi-layer nn model with forward pass and backward pass.
